# The website that lists From The Fog mods which is created by Ninjaxx

A site created by "**Eye_of_rex**" to list the mods of all seasons of the From The Fog series on Minecraft by Ninjaxx.

## How does the website work?

It's quite simple, there is a home class where all the seasons are listed with links (from 1 to 3), it's a link that takes you to the pages seasons1.html, saison2.html and saison3.html which list all mods of the respective season
